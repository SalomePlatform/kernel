This module provides utility functions to display colored text in the
terminal. It is based on ISO 6429 standard that defines control codes to
change characters representation in color-capable ASCII terminals.

In this module, colors are represented as lists of codes, so they can be added
to obtain special effects (e.g. RED + GREEN_BG to display red text on green
background). Several constants are defined for the most usual codes to
facilitate the use of colors, but it is also possible to define colors
directly from the corresponding code from ISO 6429 standard. In fact it is
even necessary for less usual codes that don't have an associated constant
(e.g. PURPLE + ['09'] can be used to display a crossed-out purple text).

Example::

    import sys
    from salome.kernel.salome.kernel import termcolor
    if termcolor.canDisplayColor(sys.stdout):
        print(termcolor.makeColoredMessage("Hello world!", termcolor.BLUE))
    else:
        print("Hello world!")
