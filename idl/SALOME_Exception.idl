/*! \file SALOME_Exception.idl \brief This file contains the objects defining the main exception used
in %SALOME application. 

The idl SALOME_Exception provides a generic CORBA exception for SALOME,
 with an attribute that gives an exception type,a message, plus optional source file name and line number. 
This idl is intended to serve for all user CORBA exceptions raised in SALOME code, as IDL specification 
does not support exception inheritance. So, all the user CORBA exceptions from SALOME could be 
handled in a single catch.
